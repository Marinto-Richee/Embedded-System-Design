# Simulation and Manual PCB layout

## Aim:
To simulate a simple circuit and draw the PCB Layout.

## Problem Statement:
Design a circuit of your choice in any simulation software. Upon successful simulation, draw the PCB layout of the designed circuit.

## Equipments Required:
Proteus Software

## Steps:
- Choose the desired components for your design.
- Place all components and make the necessary connections.
- After making all the connections, click the run button to start the simulation. 
- Finally, manually draw the PCB layout for the circuit.

## Circuit Diagram and simulation output:
